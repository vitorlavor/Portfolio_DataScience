# Project - House Rocket Company

## 🏠 About the project  

**House Rocket** is a digital platform whose business model is the purchase and sale of properties using technology.

I am a Data Scientist hired by the company to help find the best business opportunities in the real estate market. House Rocket's CEO would like to maximize the company's revenue by finding good business opportunities.

** The company is not real and this project's idea was taken from the blog Seja um Data Scientist. Click [here](https://sejaumdatascientist.com/os-5-projetos-de-data-science-que-fara-o-recrutador-olhar-para-voce/) to access the article.
