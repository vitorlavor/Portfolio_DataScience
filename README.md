# Project - House Rocket Company

# About the project

**House Rocket** is a digital platform whose business model is the purchase and sale of properties using technology.

I am a Data Scientist hired by the company to help find the best business opportunities in the real estate market. House Rocket's CEO would like to maximize the company's revenue by finding good business opportunities.

The main idea is to buy good houses at low prices and then resell them later at higher prices into two specific strategies:

* STRATEGY A - Internal renovation: this strategy aims to restructure the internal house space to built bathrooms to match the number of bedrooms.

* STRATEGY B - External Renovation: this strategy aims to add a built-up area including a master suite in the house (1 bedroom and bathroom).
